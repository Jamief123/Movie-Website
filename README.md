# Movie-Website
A movie database website where users can search for movies, view movie info, register, and leave reviews for movies.
Movie information is retrieved with the TMDB api. (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

You can see a deployed version with less features at the following url: https://jcinema.herokuapp.com/

This version has less features than the version on Github and probably won't be updated.

To run locally you need to run it with NodeJS.
You also need an api key for TMDB.

This was just a small hobby project to get some experience with technologies I haven't really used before such as NodeJS, javascript, mongoDB, and pulling live information via web APIs with JSON. All of this stuff was new to me and I just wanted to have a bit of fun with it
