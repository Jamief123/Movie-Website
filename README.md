# Movie-Website
A movie database website where users can search for movies, view movie info, register, and leave reviews for movies.
Movie information is retrieved with the TMDB api. (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

You can see a deployed version with less features at the following url: https://jcinema.herokuapp.com/

This version has less features than the version on Github and probably won't be updated.

To run locally you need to run it with NodeJS.

This was just a small hobby project to get some experience with technologies I haven't really used before such as NodeJS and pulling live information via web APIs with JSON. All of this stuff was new to me and I just wanted to have a bit of fun with it.

I planned on adding user registration and reviews but will most likely not be expanded any further.
